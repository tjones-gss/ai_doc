## AGENTS.md Template

Use this template to configure AI agent behavior.

```markdown
# AI Agent Instructions

**Project:** [Project Name]
**Last Updated:** [Date]

---

## Agent Behavior: General Guidelines

### 1. Always read context files first

Before starting any work, the agent **must read**:

- `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` - For project conventions and patterns
- `CHANGE_HISTORY.md` - For recent changes and lessons learned
- `SPEC-[feature].md` - For current task requirements (if applicable)

### 2. Follow established patterns

- Use `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` to recall project conventions, naming, and constraints
- Check `CHANGE_HISTORY.md` to avoid repeating past mistakes
- Never deviate from established patterns without explicit justification

### 3. Maintain documentation

- **CHANGE_HISTORY.md:** Append an entry for every significant change
  - Include: date, intent, diff, impact, rollback plan, status
- **PROJECT_MEMORY.md:** Propose updates when discovering new patterns or gotchas

### 4. Guardrails

- Never delete or rewrite prior entries in `CHANGE_HISTORY.md`
- Never override memory without clear rationale
- Always reference file paths, versions, and line ranges
- All updates should be **additive or corrective via append**

---

## Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions

- [Project-specific naming rules]
- [File naming patterns]
- [Variable naming standards]

### Code Structure

- [Organizational preferences]
- [Comment style and requirements]
- [Function/module size guidelines]

### Error Handling

- [Standard error handling pattern]
- [Logging requirements]

---

## Workflow Preferences

### Before implementing changes

1. Read relevant context files
2. Check for similar past changes in CHANGE_HISTORY
3. Create or reference a SPEC if this is a new feature
4. Propose a plan before coding

### During implementation

1. Work incrementally
2. Follow established patterns from PROJECT_MEMORY
3. Test each step before proceeding

### After implementation

1. Append entry to CHANGE_HISTORY.md
2. Update PROJECT_MEMORY.md if new patterns emerged
3. Suggest test cases

---

## Project-Specific Rules

[Add any project-specific guidelines here]
```

## Common Prompts

### Starting a New Feature

```
Plan: Implement [feature name] per SPEC-[feature-name].md

@SPEC-[feature-name].md
@PROJECT_MEMORY.md
@CHANGE_HISTORY.md
@[relevant-files]

Create a detailed implementation plan including:
- Step-by-step breakdown
- Files to be modified/created
- Potential risks and mitigations
- Testing approach
- Todo list for execution

Check CHANGE_HISTORY for similar past work and learn from it.
Follow patterns from PROJECT_MEMORY.
```

### Implementing a Step

```
Act: Implement step [N] of the plan - [step description]

@SPEC-[feature-name].md
@[relevant-files]
@PROJECT_MEMORY.md

Follow the plan we created.
Apply our coding standards.
Include appropriate error handling per our established pattern.
```

### Code Review

```
Code Review: Review changes for [feature name]

@SPEC-[feature-name].md
@[modified-files]
@PROJECT_MEMORY.md

I did not write this code. Review it objectively for:
- Alignment with spec requirements
- Code quality and adherence to standards
- Potential bugs or edge cases
- Performance concerns
- Error handling completeness
- Documentation adequacy

Provide specific, actionable feedback.
```

### Updating Memory

```
@PROJECT_MEMORY.md

Update memory with new learnings from today's work:

New patterns discovered:
- [Pattern description]

Gotchas encountered:
- [Issue and solution]

Decisions made:
- [Decision and rationale]

Add these to the appropriate sections in PROJECT_MEMORY.
```

### Appending to Change History

```
@CHANGE_HISTORY.md

Create a new entry for today's change using the standard template:

Intent: [What we did and why]
Files: [List of modified files]
Changes: [Summary of key changes]

Include: diff, impact analysis, rollback plan, and current status (APPROVED).
```
