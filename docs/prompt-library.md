## Tips for Effective Prompts

### Be Specific

**Bad:**

```
Fix the bug
```

**Good:**

```
@CUSTMAINT.cob:450-500

Fix the bug where credit limit validation fails for amounts exactly $100,000.
The issue is in the VALIDATE-CREDIT-LIMIT paragraph around line 475.
Expected: amounts up to and including $100,000 should be accepted.
Actual: $100,000 is rejected.
```

### Provide Context

**Bad:**

```
Add error handling
```

**Good:**

```
@CUSTMAINT.cob
@PROJECT_MEMORY.md

Add comprehensive error handling to the FILE-OPERATIONS section (lines 200-250).
Follow our standard error handling pattern from PROJECT_MEMORY.
Use our ERR-XXXX error code format and log to AUDIT-FILE.
```

### Break Down Complex Tasks

**Bad:**

```
Build the entire customer management feature
```

**Good:**

```
Plan: Build customer management feature per SPEC-customer-mgmt.md

First, create a detailed plan breaking this into 10-15 implementable steps.
Each step should be testable independently.
Then we'll implement step by step.
```

### Use File References

**Bad:**

```
Look at the customer program
```

**Good:**

```
@CUSTMAINT.cob
@CP-CUSTHDR.cpy
@PROJECT_MEMORY.md

Analyze the customer update logic in CUSTMAINT.cob paragraph UPDATE-CUSTOMER
```
